### Hi, I'm Andrew Woo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software and Reverse Engineer at Caesar Creek Software, with a strong background in computing systems and low-level development.

I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2025, specializing in Computing Systems. I also earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in May 2024, graduating with Highest Honors and with threads in Systems Architecture and Information Internetworks.

I'm passionate about cyber/hardware security, computing systems, edge-computing, embedded systems, systems architecture, high performance computing, and cutting-edge avionics and space systems.
