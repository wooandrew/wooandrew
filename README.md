### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andrew Woo.
I'm a Master's student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science with concentration in Computing Systems. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Highest Honors from Georgia Tech in May of 2024, with threads in Systems Architecture and Information/Internetworks.

I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Georgia Institute of Technology, assisting in the advancement of research into satellite systems in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and developing simulations for satellites in cis-lunar and lunar orbit.

I'm passionate about computing systems, edge-computing, embedded systems, systems architecture, high performance computing, and cutting-edge avionics and space systems.
